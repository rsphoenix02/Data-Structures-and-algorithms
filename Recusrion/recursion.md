When a function call itself until a base condition is met is called Recursion.

Tail Recursion - When a function call itself and that recursive call is last statement in that function then it is Tail Recursion.
All the logic will be done at calling time.

Head Recursion - When a function call is first statement in function it is known as head recursion. All the logic is done at the time of returning.

Linear Recursion - If A function is calling itself ocne in a function in the middle of statements it is linear recursion

Tree Recursion - 

Indirect Recursion -
