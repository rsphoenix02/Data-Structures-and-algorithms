Stack is a linear data structure which operates in a LIFO(Last In First Out) or  FILO (First In Last Out) pattern.

It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example – a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.

Stack is an abstract data type with a bounded (predefined) capacity.

It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a particular order.

The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

Standard Stack Operations – 
push() –  Place an item onto the stack. If there is no place for new item, stack is in overflow state.
pop() – Return the item at the top of the stack and then remove it. If pop is called when stack is empty, it is in an underflow state.
isEmpty() –  Tells if the stack is empty or not
isfull() – Tells if the stack is full or not.
peek() – Access the item at the i position
count() – Get the number of items in the stack.
change() – Change the item at the i position
display() – Display all items in the stack
