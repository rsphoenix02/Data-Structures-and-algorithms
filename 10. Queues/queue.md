Queue is a linear data structure(data elements connected to each other) which operates in a First IN First OUT or Last IN Last OUT.

It is named queue as it behaves like a real-world queue, for example – queue(line) of cars in a single lane, queue of people waiting at food counter etc.

Queue is an abstract data type with a bounded (predefined) capacity.

It is a simple data structure that allows adding and removing elements in a particular order.

The order is FIFO(First IN First OUT) or LILO(Last In Last Out).

Standard Queue Operations – 
Enqueue() – Add item to the queue from the REAR.
Dequeue() – Remove item from the queue from the FRONT.
isFull() – Check if queue is full or not.
isEmpty() – Check if queue empty or not.
count() – Get number of items in the queue.
