A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers(entity that point to the next element)

In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

# Some Standard Linked List Operations –
Traverse – Iterate through the nodes in the linked list starting from the head node.
Append – Attach a new node (to the end) of a list
Prepend – Attach a new node (to the beginning) of the list
Insert – attach a new node to a specific position on the list
Delete – Remove/Delink a node from the list
Count – Returns the no of nodes in linked list

# Types of Linked List –

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List

# Some Applications of Linked List DS –
1. Linked Lists can be used to implement Stacks , Queues.
2. Linked Lists can also be used to implement Graphs. (Adjacency list representation of Graph).
3. Implementing Hash Tables :- Each Bucket of the hash table can itself be a linked list. (Open chain hashing).
4. Undo functionality in Photoshop or Word . Linked list of states.
